# Veggie Rescue ü•ï
## A donation tracking platform for [Veggie Rescue](https://www.veggierescue.org/)
Veggie Rescue collects fresh fruits, vegetables and prepared food from local farms, farmers markets, backyards and businesses, then delivers this food directly to nonprofit recipient organizations and schools feeding community members in need. By creating a digital system that allows drivers to log donation information on pickups, the movement of food can be more easily tracked, allowing Veggie Rescue to effeciently administer their resources. Additionally, our platform handles driver availability and allows for easy report generation for both donations and driver activities.
